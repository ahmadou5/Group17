# Detailed Presentation Summary Of Group 17.

## Introduction Overview

This comparison covers four fundamental programming languages that represent different paradigms and use cases in modern software development. Each language has evolved to serve specific needs in the programming ecosystem.

## Key Historical Context

- **C (1969-1973)**: Foundation language for system programming, created by Dennis Ritchie
- **C++ (1979)**: Extension of C with object-oriented features by Bjarne Stroustrup
- **Java (1995)**: Platform-independent language by James Gosling for enterprise development
- **Python (1991)**: Readable, versatile language by Guido van Rossum emphasizing simplicity

## Performance Hierarchy (Presentation Talking Points)

1. **C/C++**: Direct compilation to machine code provides maximum performance
2. **Java**: JIT compilation offers good performance with platform independence
3. **Python**: Interpreted nature prioritizes development speed over execution speed

## When to Choose Each Language

### Choose C when:

- Building operating systems or embedded systems
- Maximum performance is critical
- Direct hardware access is required
- Memory usage must be minimal

### Choose C++ when:

- Need both performance and object-oriented features
- Developing games or real-time applications
- Building desktop applications
- Working with existing C codebases

### Choose Java when:

- Building enterprise-scale applications
- Platform independence is required
- Need robust memory management
- Working in large development teams

### Choose Python when:

- Rapid prototyping is needed
- Working with data science or AI/ML
- Building web applications quickly
- Automation and scripting tasks

## Conclusion for Presentation

The choice between these languages isn't about which is "best" - it's about matching the right tool to the specific requirements of your project, considering factors like performance needs, development timeline, team expertise, and long-term maintenance requirements.
